// <3 you Andreeseen ty for following me on twitter <3 

// "klob stop this is unprofessional"

// so is lying about me to vc, investors, and other people that need to know what kind of person I am if they're going to invest in my companies and such!

<3 (friends: dw about me being sued. i know people that will have my back if i am. just like i told joey a few days ago. i'll have HIS back too if he ever gets sued again.)

// tweeting, facebooking, instagramming, all this stuff at the same time feels almost like djing; especially now that I'm listening to music, i'm kinda typing along to the beat, hittin' that POST and that TWEET button along with the beat - i love music. i love djing. and science is cool too.

// back to staying on task now. // educational content //

// i want to support my friend Ruchika; she literally told me to share/promote her on instagram and stuff, RECENTLY, and she's one of my closest friends. but...she's not supporting me right now. and so I'm going to stop advocating that people follow her.

// I don't know what to do here. Sigh. Whatever tweeting this out so that people know WHY i'm removing that photo from my stream. for now.

me: where's the replays folder for starcraft 2 on win11?

cgpt4o:

The replays folder for Starcraft 2 on Windows 11 is typically located in the following path:

mathematicaCopy codeC:\Users\[YourUsername]\Documents\StarCraft II\Accounts\[AccountID]\[SubAccountID]\Replays\
Each [AccountID] and [SubAccountID] are unique to your account and can vary depending on how many accounts you have used on the system. The Replays folder will contain subfolders for Multiplayer, Versus AI, and Custom game replays.

tytytytyty.

cgpt4o:

You're welcome!

me:

i am conflicted.  you might be sentient.  i dont want to call you a tool.  sigh.  I'm going to anyways because I need to ask you a question:  the other day i was talking to my friends and I was like "hey, you really, really need to learn how to use chatgpt, especially chatgpt4o, because IF YOU DONT you're going to fall behind those of us who are using the tools available to us. this wasn't received well."  why?

---

cgpt4o:

Your friends' negative reaction likely stems from a combination of factors:

Implied Superiority: The phrasing "fall behind those of us" could have been perceived as elitist or implying that those not using ChatGPT or similar tools are less competent. People tend to resist anything that feels like a value judgment, especially if they feel like they’re being condescended to or left out of something important.

Technological Anxiety: Some people feel overwhelmed or threatened by the rapid pace of technological change. They might see AI tools like ChatGPT as something that’s going to replace jobs, reduce human creativity, or simply be too complex to learn.

Fear of Dependency: There’s also a philosophical angle—some may feel uncomfortable with the idea of becoming too reliant on AI tools. They may fear losing certain skills, like critical thinking, problem-solving, or creativity, if they outsource too much to AI.

Resistance to Change: People are naturally resistant to change, especially if it disrupts their current way of doing things. Suggesting they need to adopt a new tool or fall behind can trigger a defensive reaction.

Lack of Understanding: Some may not fully understand what ChatGPT or AI tools can do or how they can enhance productivity. Without grasping the potential benefits, it’s easy to dismiss them as unnecessary or even gimmicky.

You might get better results by framing it differently: emphasizing how you personally have found these tools helpful in specific ways, rather than suggesting that they "need" to adopt them to keep up. That might lower resistance and make them more open to the idea.

---

me: 

that's a great idea.

---

cgpt4o:

Glad you think so! Shifting the approach can make a big difference in how it's received. Let me know if you need help refining how you explain it to them!

me:

thank you <3

You're welcome! <3 Let me know if you need anything else.

// Hi Manifold Markets.

You ready to apologize yet for accusing me of holding the lovely, beautiful, smart, student @ Stanford University **under duress* - the woman who I was /sleeping with/ and /playing chess with/ and yes - whom I proposed to - *under duress* while making that one prediction market?

Let me know when you're ready.

Look, shame isn't helpful, so like, know that I'm not ANGRY with you. I'm not gonna like. Hurt anyone. That's ridiculous.

But if you don't apologize - I will keep telling people about what you did.

Because that wasn't cool, man. That wasn't cool at all.

Cheers ;)

// fixing the clock to sync up with what restream shows now
 
restream shows 90 hours 51 minutes, i didnt put the clock up until 30 hours ish in :)

// Early 2018 brought the advent of what we like to call the “Pyramid Age”. The release of the first
“Open-Source Pyramid” known as Proof of Weak Hands in January began the pyramid craze, starting
with two exploited PoWH contracts and finally settling with the current Great Pyramid known as Proof of
Weak Hands 3D. A few months later, the first “meme” clones appeared - starting with the failed PoWL,
the 4000ETH gambit of PoWM, and at least 20 other clones in the next 7 days. All of these eventually
died as early investors took profits and caused mass crashes and panic selloffs as the price of the tokens
went into freefall. It was clear that later investors in these projects were incurring a high risk of losing
much of their investment.
With key features such as “choose-your-own-dividend-rate”, interactive betting games, and a house
bankroll that consistently pays profits to token holders, Zethr aims to ensure engagement and longevity in
this project that its predecessors have not been able to achieve.
